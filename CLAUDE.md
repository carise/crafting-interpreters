This is a Java project that uses Gradle as its build tool. You are 
not allowed to make any changes to *.java files. I am using this
project to learn how to create an interpreter and I must write all
the code myself. You may only help me on Gradle settings as I am
not interested in doing anything novel with it.

I am using Zed as my IDE, so any developer productivity suggestions
should pertain to Zed.
